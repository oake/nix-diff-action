# THIS IS A BAD FORK

> [!CAUTION]
> This is a fork of the awesome [nix-diff-action](https://github.com/natsukium/nix-diff-action). My fork contains changes that fit my workflow, but break expected behaviour for others. To make it worse, these changes are not gated by configuration options. To make it even worse, some of these changes are vibecoded. **DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION**. Instead, use the original [nix-diff-action](https://github.com/natsukium/nix-diff-action).

Below this line is the original README.md content at the time of forking.

# nix-diff-action

A GitHub Action to compare Nix derivations between base and PR branches using [dix](https://github.com/faukah/dix).

> [!WARNING]
> **Alpha Version** - This action is under active development. APIs and behavior may change without notice. We recommend pinning to a specific release version or commit SHA.

## Features

- Compare Nix derivations and post diff results as PR comments
- Support for multiple derivations
- Three operation modes for different use cases
- Compare derivation (.drv) or built output paths

## Requirements

- Nix with flakes enabled (requires a Nix installer action, e.g., [cachix/install-nix-action](https://github.com/cachix/install-nix-action))

> [!NOTE]
> This action now only supports Nix flakes. Traditional Nix expressions (`nix-build`) are not supported.

## Quick Start

```yaml
name: Nix Diff

on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  nix-diff:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@main
      - uses: cachix/install-nix-action@main
      - uses: natsukium/nix-diff-action@main
        with:
          attributes: |
            - displayName: my-nixos
              attribute: nixosConfigurations.my-nixos.config.system.build.toplevel
            - displayName: my-macos
              attribute: darwinConfigurations.my-macos.system
```

## Modes

### Full Mode

For most users. Runs diffs sequentially and posts a single comment.

```yaml
- uses: natsukium/nix-diff-action@main
  with:
    attributes: |
      - displayName: host1
        attribute: nixosConfigurations.host1.config.system.build.toplevel
      - displayName: host2
        attribute: nixosConfigurations.host2.config.system.build.toplevel
```

### Diff-Only Mode

For parallel execution with matrix strategy. Runs diff and uploads results as artifacts. Typically used in combination with the following comment-only mode.

### Comment-Only Mode

Aggregates all diff results from artifacts and posts a single PR comment. Used together with diff-only mode.

Here's an example of combining both modes:

```yaml
jobs:
  diff:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
    strategy:
      matrix:
        host: [host1, host2, host3]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@main
      - uses: cachix/install-nix-action@main
      - uses: natsukium/nix-diff-action@main
        with:
          mode: diff-only
          attributes: |
            - displayName: ${{ matrix.host }}
              attribute: nixosConfigurations.${{ matrix.host }}.config.system.build.toplevel

  comment:
    needs: diff
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      actions: read
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: natsukium/nix-diff-action@main
        with:
          mode: comment-only
```

## Inputs

| Input              | Required | Default   | Description                                                                    |
| ------------------ | -------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `mode`             | No       | `full`    | Operation mode: `full`, `diff-only`, or `comment-only`                         |
| `attributes`       | No\*     | -         | Nix attributes in YAML format. Each item should have `displayName` and `attribute` keys. |
| `build`            | No       | `false`   | Build derivations before comparing (see details below)                         |
| `directory`        | No       | `.`       | Directory containing flake.nix                                                 |
| `github-token`     | No       | `${{ github.token }}` | GitHub token for posting comments                                    |
| `skip-no-change`   | No       | `true`    | Skip posting comment when there are no differences                             |
| `comment-strategy` | No       | `create`  | `create` to always create new comment, `update` to update existing comment     |

\* `attributes` is required for `full` and `diff-only` modes. Not required for `comment-only` mode (which reads from artifacts).

### Build Option Details

By default, nix-diff-action compares derivation files (.drv) without building. This is fast and suitable for most cases.

Set `build: true` to build derivations and compare output paths instead. This enables closure size comparison but significantly increases workflow execution time. The workflow must run on a platform matching the derivation (e.g., `x86_64-linux` derivations require Linux runners, `aarch64-darwin` derivations require macOS ARM runners).

## Outputs

| Output | Description                      |
| ------ | -------------------------------- |
| `diff` | JSON array of diff results. Each item has `displayName` and `diff` keys. |

## Example Output

The action posts a comment like this to your PR:

When there are no differences, the diff section shows "No differences found".

If the diff output exceeds 60KB, it will be automatically truncated with a link to the full results in the workflow artifacts.

## Permissions

Required permissions vary by mode:

| Mode           | `contents: read`       | `pull-requests: write` | `actions: read`            |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `full`         | ✓ (git operations)     | ✓ (post comments)      | -                          |
| `diff-only`    | ✓ (git operations)     | -                      | -                          |
| `comment-only` | -                      | ✓ (post comments)      | ✓ (download artifacts)     |

## Fork Pull Requests

When using this action with pull requests from forks, the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` has limited permissions and cannot post comments to the PR. To enable commenting on fork PRs, use `pull_request_target` trigger.

> [!CAUTION]
> When using `pull_request_target`, the workflow runs in the context of the base branch with write permissions. Always use `actions/checkout` with `ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}` to checkout the PR's code, and be cautious about running untrusted code from forks.
